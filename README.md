# TS-Challenges

Afterall, to harness the full potential of TS, it is important to limit the types to as small space as possible.
Typescript, if used inefficiently, may appear a lot of extra work.


This repo is dedicated to a series of challenges from type-challenges and multiple other sources which I have completed to hone my TS skills.
